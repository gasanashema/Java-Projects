# Java OOP Concepts

## Core Concepts

### Encapsulation
- **Definition**: Data hiding
- **Data**: Attributes, properties, fields

### Access Modifiers
- **public**: Visible everywhere
- **private**: Visible only inside the class
- **protected**: Visible inside the class and subclasses

### Getter and Setter
- **Getter**: Method to get the value of a private attribute (always has a return type)
- **Setter**: Method to set the value of a private attribute

### Constructor
- Used to initialize an object
- Called when an object is created

## Keywords

### this Keyword
- Used to refer to the current object

### static Keyword
- Used to define class-level attributes and methods

### final Keyword
- Used to define constants

### super Keyword
- Used to call the constructor of the superclass
- Used to call a method of the superclass

### synchronized Keyword
- Used to make a method thread-safe
- Improves performance in multithreaded environments

## Object-Oriented Programming

### Interface
- Blueprint of a class
- A class can implement multiple interfaces

### Abstract Class
- Class that cannot be instantiated
- Can have abstract methods (methods without a body)

### Inheritance
- Way to create a new class based on an existing class
- Used to reuse code

### Polymorphism
- Way to create objects with different types
- Used to perform a single action in different ways

### Method Overloading
- Creating multiple methods with the same name but different parameters
- Used to perform the same action in different ways

### Method Overriding
- Creating a new method in a subclass with the same name and parameters as a method in the superclass
- Used to perform the same action in different ways

## Code Organization

### Package
- Collection of classes
- Used to organize code

### Import Statement
- Used to import classes from other packages
- Used to import classes from the same package

## Exception Handling

### Exception Handling
- Way to handle errors
- Prevents the program from crashing

### try-catch Block
- Way to handle errors
- Prevents the program from crashing

### finally Block
- Way to handle errors
- Prevents the program from crashing

### throw Statement
- Way to throw an exception
- Prevents the program from crashing

### throws Statement
- Way to declare exceptions that a method might throw
- Prevents the program from crashing

## Advanced Features

### Serialization
- Way to save an object to a file
- Used to save the state of an object

### Deserialization
- Way to load an object from a file
- Used to load the state of an object

### Multithreading
- Way to run multiple tasks at the same time
- Used to improve performance

### Lambda Expressions
- Way to create anonymous functions
- Used to simplify code

### Streams
- Way to work with collections of objects
- Used to simplify code

### Generics
- Way to create generic classes and methods
- Used to simplify code

### Annotations
- Way to add metadata to classes and methods
- Used to simplify code

### Reflection
- Way to get information about classes and methods
- Used to simplify code

### Garbage Collection
- Way to manage memory
- Used to improve performance

## Development Tools

### Javadoc
- Way to document code
- Used to improve code quality

### IDE
- Way to write code
- Used to improve code quality

### Build Tools
- Way to compile code
- Used to improve code quality

### Version Control
- Way to manage code
- Used to improve code quality

### Testing Frameworks
- Way to test code
- Used to improve code quality

### Design Patterns
- Way to solve common problems
- Used to improve code quality
